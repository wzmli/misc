Happy Valentines Day! â™¥ 

We are thinking now about why Mike's simple simulations (implicitly polarized) don't exactly match any known, straightforward glm approach.

We can get exact answers for a single comparison easily enough (e.g., by fitting the standard logistic and reconstructing). But it's not super-clear how to get the right CIs for this, and even less clear how to add complexities and still be straightforward.

We note that we expect to be able to match a hazard-based simulation perfectly (at least in some cases) with a cloglog regression, but this is more like a leaky than like a polarized paradigm.

Mike wants to go forward for now with a parametric bootstrap approach that JD doesn't understand -- but could be a good chance to make some checkplots or slugplots or whatever.
